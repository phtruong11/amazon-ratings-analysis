# Amazon Product Ratings Analysis <br />
**Project Overview**<br />
The goal of this project is to determine how ratings influence the sales of products on Amazon, and predict whether the rating is helpful or not.
This project is beneficial to both Amazon vendors and future customers,
as customers will be able to find the most helpful reviews by other customers before deciding to purchase a product, and Amazon vendors can consider these ratings and reviews to adjust their products to meet customers' needs and therefore improve future sales.<br />
